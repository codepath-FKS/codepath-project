## Overview
### Description

A gamified To-Do list app in which you take care of a virtual pet named Todo!

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity, Self-care, Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Push notifications for task deadlines, camera capture for task verification
- **Story:** The app would have a clear value
- **Market:** Everyone can use this app to complete their tasks! It appeals to people of all ages, because everyone loves pets. It provides a support system for people who are seeking to improve their productivity.
- **Habit:** Users would login daily. They don't simply consume content but they interact with the app.
- **Scope:** This app would be moderately challenging to complete. A version with less integral features would still be interesting to build. It's pretty defined.
